          "Let's ride!!!" <br />
          <br />
          When Russell Wilson uttered the catchphrase at his introductory press
          conference with the Broncos, the football world assumed that the
          partnership between the nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback and the
          three-time Super Bowl-winning franchise would eventually become a
          "forever" relationship.
          <br />
          <br />
          With the Broncos agreeing to a five-year, $245 million contract
          extension that ties Wilson to the franchise through the 2028 season,
          the marriage provides the team with stability at the game's most
          important position. Remember, this franchise has operated a revolving
          door at the position since Peyton Manning led the team to a victory in
          Super Bowl 50. <br />
          <br />
          The team has started 11 different quarterbacks during the span,
          including Brock Osweiler, Trevor Siemian, Paxton Lynch, Joe Flacco,
          Case Keenum, Drew Lock and Teddy Bridgewater. Given their individual
          and collective struggles, it is easy to see why the Broncos were
          willing to hand Wilson the bag before he takes an official snap with
          the team. <br />
