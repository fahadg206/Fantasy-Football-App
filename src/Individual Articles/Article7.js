          We are excited to introduce our new sponsor.... SalTheMan!
          <br />
          <br />
          Sal has been an active member of the league since its founding and has
          consistently competed at the highest level. His competitive and
          winning culture truly exemplifies what this league is about, thatâ€™s
          why this year's hardware (Whether a belt or trophy, let us know on
          Twitter!) will be named after him!
          <br />

          </div>
          <br />
          <br />
          Everyone join me in thanking Sal for his gracious efforts and we wish
          him the best luck this season and in the many seasons to come! <br />
