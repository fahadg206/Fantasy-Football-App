          It's been an exciting couple of weeks of fantasy football! Here's a
          recap of how the league's been shaping up so far! 1-1. <br />
          <br />
          <p className="font-bold">Ed vs Nomu:</p> <br />
          Nomu, coming off of the narrowest of victories (0.54 to be exact) took
          on Ed who had his eyes set on bouncing back from a clobbering the week
          prior. Nomu was not able to squeak by this week, losing by a close
          margin of 4 points. Ed was led by quarterback Josh Allen (29 points)
          and “The Cheetah” Tyreek Hill (35 points). Nomu, who came into this
          game undermanned missing Alvin Kamara and Michael Pittman, gave it a
          valiant effort bringing the . Numo drops to 1-1 while Ed improves to
          1-1.
          <br />
          <br />
          <p className="font-bold">Odd Jobs vs Akhjefe:</p> <br />
          A very rough start to the season for Akhjefe. After losing a
          heartbreaker by the virtue of decimals last week, Akhjefe received a
          TEXAS STYLE LYNCHING in Week 2. His opponent, Odd Jobs, is off to an
          impressive start. Being only one of two teams to start the season 2-0.
          Despite Odd Job’s RB1 and RB2 combining for 10 points, he was able to
          come out victorious. Kooper “Konsistent” Kupp had himself a
          prototypical Kupp game, dropping 26 point, and Slant Boy contributed
          with a solid 15. Stay tuned, these two teams are heading in completely
          opposite directions.
          <br />
          <br />
          <p className="font-bold">Enough Saaid vs School Threat:</p> <br />
          Two teams that had their Week 1 matchups come down to the wire. But
          both teams had different outcomes. Enough Saaid fell short by just
          enough points (2.5 to be exact) while School Threat gutted out a win
          by .74 points. School Threat lived up to his name by bringing his guns
          to work by firing off 145 rounds. Led by the notorious gunman, Tua was
          shooting at a high clip dropping 38 points and rookie shooter Garrett
          Wilson added on with 26 points of his own. The Redemption League
          alumni is off to a blazing start (2-0) and is looking to make his mark
          in the Champions League. While Enough Saaid is off to a disappointing
          start and looks to bounce back in Week 3 before it's too late.
          <br />
          <br />
          <p className="font-bold">Ganay vs GojoSleep:</p> <br />
          These two teams have been involved in close affairs for back to back
          weeks. Ganay tiptoed to a win last week by GojoSleep fell just short.
          The most mysterious man in the league, GojoSleep was led by Lamar
          Jackson who played out of his cotton picking mind and dropped 42
          points. Complimented by 15 points from rookie receiver Jahan Dotson 12
          points from kicker Tyler Bass. Ganay is kicking himself for leaving
          running back Tony Pollard on the bench and starting receiver BuBu
          Smith-Schuster. GojoSleep aims to build off a good team win while
          Ganay strives to bounce back.
          <br />
          <br />
          <p className="font-bold">Sal vs YSLBigNervous:</p> <br />
          A matchup of budding rivals and it did not disappoint. YSL coming off
          a huge shocking unprecedented upset win over the reigning champ vs Sal
          coming off a shocking unexpected hard fought loss.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sal fell in a hole early after Nick Chubb’s 30 point performance (I
          mean c'mon who would blow a lead after that right?). YSL could not
          capitalize off that as he got duds from his first round pick Ja’Marr
          Chase and tight end Dalton Schultz. Sal received a heroic outing by
          his defense who came through clutch with 29 points to neutralize
          Chubb.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sal’s entire team showed up for this one as everyone in his lineup put
          up double digits, excluding his kicker Matt Ammendola who had 9 points
          (I mean c'mon who expected a backup to even put up 9 points… genius).
          We expect both of these teams have their Week 13 rematch circled on
          their respective calendars. But one asked about the highly anticipated
          rematch, Sal had this to say “I had a game week 13? I thought it was a
          bye, no worries I guess it’s just another game on the schedule”
          <br />
          <br />
          <p className="font-bold">Mikey vs FG:</p>
          <br />
          SThe matchup heard around the world. The matchup everyone wanted to
          see. America’s Game. Of. The. Week. This game lived up to its billing
          and Mikey came to collect. FG came into this game CONFIDENT after a
          huge win last week.
          <br />
          <br />
          He continued off that momentum as he got off to a furious start (As he
          always does), getting 34 a piece from his duo of 2nd year receivers
          Jaylen Waddle and Amon-Ra St. Brown. With Curtis Samuel chipping in
          with 19, the Champ, Mikey, found himself in a hole going into Monday
          night, down 35 points, with one player left.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Nothing out of the ordinary here, we've been in this situations
          before, especially against FG” When asked what his strategy was he
          said “Just give them a head start, he’ll flame out eventually, no lead
          is safe with the champ under the helm” Stefon helped digg the champ
          out of the brink of defeat with a world-class performance, single
          handedly bringing the W home with scoring 38 points propelling Mikey
          to a 149-146 victory. FG continues to be haunted by Mikey’s
          receivers…He just can’t CATCH a break!
