# RainCity League

- An interactive and mobile responsive fantasy football website built using the Sleeper API and MERN stack. Your one stop destination for all the latest news and headlines across all our leagues!


## Project Goals

- The purpose of our site was to make our league more interactive for all our members who are very passionate about fantasy football. Before breaking into building the website, we made sure to take our members ideas and what they would like to see on the website into consideration. It provides a tailored experience to our leagues where our members get the opportunity to get their thoughts and opinions heard. 

## Features

- Topics include introduction to new league members, breakdown of each division, trades, rumors, league events & much more to come.

### Polls
- Our method of getting engagement from our members where they're able to vote hot league topics, matchup predictions, and even future league ideas.  

### Power Rankings
- Bi-weekly power rankings to display how the league is shaping out. 


## Technologies Used

- ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, Sleeper API, Tailwind CSS, NPM, Axios, Heroku, Vercel.


## Future Plans

1. Optimization and efficiency to our functionality. 
2. Integrating a discord bot to provide on demand league information and data/analytics for our members using Python. 
3. To make the league even more immersive, we'll be incorporating league members ideas such as league history, past articles, user authentication & more!
